ABOUT THE DATA:

This dataset consists of some important attributes which effect the performance the player such as
Runs, Wickets, Average etc.

OBJECTIVE:

In cricket, each team has 11 players with specific roles: batsmen score runs, bowlers take wickets, and
allrounders contribute in both the aspects. Player performance varies based on who they're playing
against and where the match is held. To pick the best team for One Day International (ODI) matches, we
use past stats and player characteristics to predict how many runs a batsman will score or how many
wickets a bowler will take. This project uses machine learning to make these predictions for upcoming
matches.

The Path:

Trying different machine learning models to find the most suitable one for the dataset.
